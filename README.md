## Blocks and Items

### Applied Energistics 2
- ME Wire Connector
    - This acts the same as a wire connector from IE, except instead of power it will connect to an AE system, just like a fluix cable.
- ME Dense Wire Connector
    - Same as the non-dense counterpart however transfers 32 channels instead of just 8.
- Fluix Wire Coil
    - This is the wire used to connect ME Wire Connectors together.
- Dense Wire Coil
    - Same as fluix wire coil but for the dense wire connectors.

### Other
- Wooden Post Extension
    - Place on top of a wooden post to add more places to put wire connectors. Use the hammer like with the wooden post to add arms.
